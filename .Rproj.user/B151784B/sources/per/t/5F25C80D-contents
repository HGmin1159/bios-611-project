## Report on the association between Covid 19 and Economic power.

#### Data Set : COVID 19 worldwide case (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sandhyakrishnan02/latest-covid-19-dataset-worldwide?resource=download), World Economic Outlook data set (https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/SPROLLs/world-economic-outlook-databases#sort=%40imfdate%20descending)

My primary question is about the association between economy and COVID-19 of each country. Along with the primary dataset about COVID-19, I operated several statistical analysis including dimensionality reduction, clustering analysis and regression analysis.
