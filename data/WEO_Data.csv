Base year: 2005 Methodology used to derive volumes: Deflation by unit value indexes (from customs data). Export and import price indices were calculated as unit value indices, in other words, indices of the change of the export and import value per quantity unit of exported/imported goods, that is, per kilogram as a uniform and comparable quantity unit for all goods. Formula used to derive volumes: Fisher. Export and import price indices were calculated according to the Fisher's, so-called ideal, formula, which is a geometrical mean between the Laspeyres' and Paasche's formulae. Chain-weighted: No. Export and import price indices are calculated as monthly or quarterly as compared to the base year (previous year). For example, export and import price indices for the first quarter of 2011 are calculated as compared to the period from January to December 2010. Trade System: Special trade.

Oil coverage: Primary or unrefined products; Secondary or refined products; Other; Valuation of exports: Free on board (FOB). The export values are calculated on the basis of the FOB parity. It means that the invoice value is reduced for transportation and other costs incurred from the Croatian border to the place of delivery abroad, if it is agreed that goods are delivered abroad.

Guinea,"Inflation, average consumer prices",Index,,"Source: National Statistics Office Latest actual data: 2022 Notes: The change in inflation reflects the transition to the new CPI data that the authorities released in November 2022. The new index, starting from August 2022, has updated its weights from 2002 to 2019, and expanded coverage to include the entire country instead of just Conakry as in the previous index. It was developed with technical assistance from AFRISTAT and reviewed by STA. The figures presented in the tables rely only on Conakry's information, as there is insufficient data available for the other regions to calculate an annual average. Further changes will need to be accommodated once there is sufficient data availability to transition to the full-country index. The new CPI results in a lower inflation rate at the end of 2022 and a faster decline in inflation in 2023.

The GDP components(consumption, investment, exports and imports) are distributed proportionally based on the average share of two fiscal year GDP data. For example, CY2018 gross capital formation= CY2018 GDP *average(FY2017/18+FY 2018/19 gross capital formation)/average(FY2017/18+FY 2018/19 GDP). Start/end months of reporting year: January/December.

Historical quarterly data are taken from Haver to have a smooth series. Base year: 2016. National Accounts were rebased on a FY basis and this rebasing was then applied to CY historical data.
