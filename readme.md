Hi, this is my 611 Data Science Project. More to come.

## Blueprint for BIOS 611 Project

#### Data Set : COVID 19 worldwide case (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sandhyakrishnan02/latest-covid-19-dataset-worldwide?resource=download)

My primary question is about the effect of COVID-19 on each country. Along with the primary dataset
about COVID-19, I'll figure out the impact of COVID-19 in the economic aspects with GDP, Export and
Import, and Employment Rate and health aspects including Death Rate, Health Budgets, Vacinnaction.

Every topic is straightforward but challenging to show. The most difficult one is to show the trend of
more than 50 countries. Therefore, I'll focus on visualization. I plan to use a dynamic plot on the world
map showing changing trends of the case and economic indexes. And show some straightforward
statements along with regression analysis and factor analysis. Because of the lack of data, the terms
of the data vary from month to year. I plan to fill the empty data by smoothing, only for visualization.

My ultimate goal is making figure intuitive enough to deliver the information and analyses at a glance. I
plan to do it through python (seaborn, geopandas and bokeh) or R (ggplot, ggmap and shiny)
